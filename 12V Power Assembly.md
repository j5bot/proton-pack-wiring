2. 4 x F connector (pre-wired red/black, 18g)
3. 4 x M connector (pre-wired red/black, 18g)
4. 2 x DC barrel jack (pre-wired red/black, 18g)
5. 1 x 12V Y-Cable -- 1F to 2M ends
6. 3 x 12V extension cables (maybe more, depending on mounting locations)
7. wire nuts
8. butt connectors
9. cable and wire management supplies (zip ties and/or hook-and-loop strips; cable clips) as desired

## Power Sub-Assemblies

### Battery Connection Sub-Assemblies

1. Connect one pre-wired 12V DC M connector (part #1) to two F (part #2) pre-wired connectors 
using butt connectors or wire nuts to join (label it BCC1, connectors IN and IN)
2. Repeat step one (label it BCC2, connectors OUT and OUT)

BCC1 is the primary battery and charging sub-assembly

BCC2 is the power out and secondary battery sub-assembly

### Bypass Switch Sub-Assembly

1. Mount the DPDT switch where desired
2. Label a M connector (part #3) OUT
3. Label a M connector (part #3) IN
4. Solder the black wire from the IN M connector onto the left top terminal of the DPDT switch
5. Solder the black wire from the OUT M connector onto the left center terminal of the DPDT switch
6. Solder the red wire from the IN M connector onto the right top terminal of the DPDT switch
7. Solder the red wire from the OUT M connector onto the right center top terminal of the DPDT 
   switch

### Power Input Sub-Assemblies

1. For both DC ports, mount the DC barrel jack / port where desired, and then connect to M 
connector (part #2), using butt connectors (label the wires PWR1 and PWR2)
