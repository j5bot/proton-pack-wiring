# GP⭐️ Power Isolation Circuit (12V + 5V)

![isolation switch](isolation-switch.jpg)

## Parts

For this circuit you will need:

- An On/On DPDT switch (this is the typical DPDT type)
  
  All of your power is going to go through this switch so you may want to get a "beefier" one, perhaps with screw terminals as shown in the switch diagram.
- A 12V DC barrel jack (female)
  
  You will plug the battery charger into this jack when you want to charge the internal battery.
  You can purchase pre-wired jacks which will make this easier for you.
- A 12V DC plug (male)
  
  You will plug this into the internal battery's 12V jack.
  When the switch is in the "On" position, this will connect the battery to the GP⭐️ 12V electronics.
  When it is in the "Charge" position, this will connect the battery to the charger, through the charge port.
  This can also be purchased pre-wired.
- A USB-A plug (male)
  
  You will plug this into the internal battery's 5V USB port.
  When the switch is in the "On" position, it will connect the battery to the GP⭐️ 5V electronics.
  This can of course be purchased pre-wired.

- If using pre-wired cables: Some way to color code 5 different red wires.

  For example, 5 (non-black) colors of electrical tape.
  5 (non-black) markers and an appropriate way to tape paper
  colored with them to thin wires.

- If creating your own cables: 5 (non-black) colors of
  18g (20g is probably ok too) wire.
