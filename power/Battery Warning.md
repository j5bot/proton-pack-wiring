# Battery Handling Warning

As part of this project, I installed a de-cased 11000mAh Talentcell into my pack.

While working with the battery outside its case (and not in the pack), I carelessly touched contacts on the board which has the switch and ports to contacts on the board which is attached to the battery cells and regulates them.  This burnt out circuitry on the boards and even started a very small fire which luckily was easily extinguished.

I cannot stress enough that although we are careful in our work on our packs that some of the things we do are not without risk.

I do not *recommend* that you follow my example and remove the case of your battery in order to install it in your pack.  You do so at your own risk.
