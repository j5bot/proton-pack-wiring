### Aux In

1. Cut 3.5mm connector cable (if necessary)
2. Connect red/black (and white if stereo) wires ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) from
   3.5mm connector cable to 2 pin F connector using butt connectors (label AUX)

### Pack Audio

1. Cut red/black wires ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) from pack main board to pack speaker
2. Connect red/black wires ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) 
   from pack main board to 2 pin F connector using butt connectors (label connector PACK)

### Speaker In

1. Connect red/black wires ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) 
   from 2 pin F connector to the new speaker

### Bypass Switch Connector

1. Connect blue wire ![wire](../images/blue-wire.png) of 4 pin F connector to red wire ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of
   2 pin M connector (label AUX)
2. Connect red wire ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of 4 pin F connector to red wire ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of
   2 pin M connector (label PACK)
3. Connect green wire ![wire](../images/green-wire.png) of 4 pin F connector to red wire 
   ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of 2 pin M connector (label SPKR)
4. Connect black wire ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) of 4 pin F connector to red wire
   ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of 2 pin M connector (label AMP)

### Bypass Switch Sub-Assembly

1. Mount bypass switch at desired location
2. Solder red wire ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of 4 pin M connector to right center of bypass switch
3. Solder green wire ![wire](../images/green-wire.png) of 4 pin M connector to left center of bypass switch
4. Solder a red wire ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) jumper of left top of bypass switch to 
   right top of bypass switch
5. Solder blue wire ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) of 4 pin M connector to right bottom of bypass switch
6. Solder black wire ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) of 4 pin M connector to left bottom of bypass switch

### Main Wire Harness

1. Connect a blue wire ![wire](../images/blue-wire.png) 'jumper' to the black wire ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) of a
   2 pin F connector using a butt connector (label AMP)
2. Connect the black wire ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) of the 4 pin F connector 
   to the red wire ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of the AMP 2 pin F connector using a butt connector
3. Connect the blue wire ![wire](../images/blue-wire.png) of the 4 pin F connector to the red wire
   ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of a 2 pin F connector (label AUX)
4. Connect the green wire ![wire](../images/green-wire.png) of the 4 pin F connector to the
   red wire ![wire](../images/red-wire.png) of a 2 pin M connector (label SPKR)

1. Connect the black wire ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) of the AUX 2 pin M connector,
   the black wire ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) of the PACK 2 pin M connector, and
   a black wire ![wire](../images/black-wire.png) 'jumper' using a butt connector
2. Connect the black 'jumper' wire from above to the black wire of the SPKR 2 pin M connector,
   and the
