## Pack Mods / Cuts

There are several areas you’ll need to cut into the proton pack if installing into the power cell “snack” compartment or a HasLab.

| Area                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Image                                                                             |

| First, there is a corner between the booster tube cavity and snack compartment cavity.  Making this cut allows for mounting switches and ports lower on the panel (Photo 1: CORNER NOTCH).                                                                                                                                                | ![corner notch-sub.jpg](photos/corner%20notch-sub.jpg)                            |
| You can reference the photo to see how far you need to cut to mount the ports in the locations where I did (Photo 1: PORT & SWITCH INSTALL LOCATIONS).                                                                                                                                                                                    | ![port and switch install-sub.jpg](photos/port%20and%20switch%20install-sub.jpg)  |
| Secondly, you’ll make the “notch” that the power cell cable normally goes through into the main top cavity deeper, allowing you to pass the power assembly wires through from the snack area into the main body (Photo 2: MODIFIED WIRE PASS-THROUGH NOTCH).                                                                              | ![wire pass-through notch-sub.jpg](photos/wire%20pass-through%20notch-sub.jpg)    |
| Optionally, in order to provide a clearer space in the snack cavity, you can remove the main board and then carefully cut a small hole between it and the ion arm / right cavity.  Once cut, turn the power cell electronics JST connector sideways, pass it through the hole carefully and plug it back in (Photo 3: POWER CELL WIRING). | ![power cell wiring-sub.jpg](photos/power%20cell%20wiring-sub.jpg)                 |
| Thirdly, you’ll cut a notch out of the bottom of the D Cell battery compartment bottom to clear more room for switches and ports on the panel (Photo 4: BATTERY COMPARTMENT NOTCH).                                                                                                                                                       | ![battery compartment notch-sub.jpg](photos/battery%20compartment%20notch-sub.jpg) |


## Replacement Panel

I chose to use an [
MDF replacement panel from ImperialTechShopUS
](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1415573195/talent-cell-hole-snack-compartment).  It was easy to work with and good 
quality overall but there were minor problems with either it or the pack itself not being square.
Probably the pack.

### Design

I designed a sticker to be placed on the panel, through which holes would be drilled for 
mounting the various components.  I didn't design any graphics or specific placement for the LED 
indicator.

The sticker is taller than it needs to be, on the bottom, because it includes space representing 
the bottom of the 'bump-out' on an original panel.

## Mounting Holes

Center punch or otherwise mark the holes you'll be drilling by pressing through the 'crosshairs' 
in the design.  Then, carefully cut out the guide circles with something like a craft knife / 
x-acto.

This will help get a nice clean hole through the sticker and a properly aligned drill.

## Quick Connect Modifications

The MALE quick connects on the ports and LED are going to have to go through the holes you drill 
in the panel.

For the ports, in order to do so, the portion of the quick connect which sticks out from the main 
body at angles will have to be snipped off.

For the LED indicator, the tabs at the end of the quick connects (not the one no the top!) will 
also need to be snipped off.  The image below shows one side, but there are tabs on the hidden 
side, too.

## Assembly

1. Run the wiring through the holes in the panel.
