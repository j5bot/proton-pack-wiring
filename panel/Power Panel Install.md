## Pack Mods / Cuts

There are several areas you’ll need to cut into the proton pack if installing into the power cell “snack” compartment or a HasLab.

First, there is a corner between the booster tube cavity and snack compartment cavity.  Making 
this cut allows for mounting switches and ports lower on the panel (Photo 1: CORNER NOTCH).

You can reference the photo to see how far you need to cut to mount the ports in the locations 
where I did (Photo 1: PORT & SWITCH INSTALL LOCATIONS).

Secondly, you’ll make the “notch” that the power cell cable normally goes through into the main 
top cavity deeper, allowing you to pass the power assembly wires through from the snack area 
into the main body (Photo 2: MODIFIED WIRE PASS-THROUGH NOTCH).

Optionally, in order to provide a clearer space in the snack cavity, you can remove the main board and then carefully cut a small hole between it and the ion arm / right cavity.  Once cut, turn the power cell electronics JST connector sideways, pass it through the hole carefully and plug it back in.

Thirdly, you’ll cut a notch out of the bottom of the D Cell battery compartment bottom to clear 
more room for switches and ports on the panel (Photo 3: BATTERY COMPARTMENT NOTCH).

## Replacement Panel

I chose to use an MDF replacement panel from ImperialTechShopUS, which I have mixed feelings about.  It was easy to work with and good quality overall but there were minor problems with either it or the pack itself not being square.  More than this however, this replacement panel does not have the bottom “bump out” that covers screws and “internal” features of the pack like the original panel does.
