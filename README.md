## [12V Power Assembly](power/12V%20Power%20Assembly.md)

This mod provides a 12V DC battery charging port, a primary battery bypass switch, a 12V DC 
secondary battery port, and dual 12V DC power out for amplifier and keep-alive / main board.

<!--
### For Users of 5V / 6V Keep-Alives or Pack Electronics

Especially for HasLab pack users, a 12V to 6V step down
converter is recommended rather than using the 5V USB
output from the Talentcell battery.

A separate page will be created for how to add the
step down to this circuit.
