# HasLab Spengler Proton Pack / Other Pack Wiring
Diagrams and how-tos for wiring up your proton pack's power and audio

## [12V Power Assembly](power/12V%20Power%20Assembly.md)

With this power assembly, you'll be able to:

- Charge your internal battery from an external charging port
- Isolate your pack electronics when charging your internal battery using a bypass switch
- Via a 12V port, use a secondary power source (external battery) which will be isolated from the
  internal battery using the same bypass switch
- See whether your pack electronics are isolated from your internal battery / charger based on
  an LED indicator being blue
- See whether your pack electronics are getting power from either an internal or external power
  source based on an LED indicator being red

### For Users of 5V / 6V Keep-Alives or Pack Electronics

Especially for HasLab pack users, a 12V to 6V step down
converter is recommended rather than using the 5V USB
output from the Talentcell battery.

A separate page will be created for how to add the
step down to this circuit.
